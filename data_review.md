DATA COLLECTION REVIEW RESPONSE:

1. Is there any way to be able to identify the person who tags the video in the extension? I see you stated "users can anonymously tag videos" in your comment, but I wanted to make sure about the anonymity of people's identity. Can you please confirm?

No. There is no way to identify the person who tags the video in the extension. All we will have is a random ID like "abcd1234", to tell apart one installation of the extension from another. This random ID does not include any personal information. So, for example, if I install the extension on both my laptop and my desktop, one of them will be "abcd1234" and the other will be "abcd5678", and there will be no way to tell that they are actually owned by the same person, or located in the same IP or geographical region.

2. Is it clearly stated to the user, when using the extension, that tagging will not being identified as who did the tagging?

Yes. It is clearly stated to the user that tagging will not being identified as who did the tagging. In fact we use the exact example I mentioned in question 1 above.

3. If the data is identifiable (meaning we can know who did the tagging on what video), is it clearly stated to the user what we use the data for and whether we share it with 3rd parties

The data will not be identifiable. All we will know is that "computer abcd1234 tagged these videos". But nevertheless, we clearly state how the data will be used and who it will be shared with.

4. By using SurveyMonkey as a survey tool at the end, do you collect any personal data and do you state clearly what are you using the survey for, and whether you share the data with 3rd parties?

The SurveyMonkey will also be opt-in, independently from the extension. By that I mean that users will be free to download the extension without participating in the survey.
The survey contains demographic questions, such as race/ethnicity and gender, which will be used to understand the demographics of the people contributing to this project. All of the demographics results will be used in aggregate: we will not look at the race or gender of user "abcd1234", but rather at the overall percentage of each race or gender category in our study. The information shared with third parties will only be at this aggregate level.
Finally, We state all of that clearly so that users are fully informed.
